Nine species of baleen whales and 36 species of toothed whales make their home in Aussie waters, and research suggests new species may well be found here in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, whales, dolphins and porpoises are protected in Australian waters, and thanks to conservation measures, whale populations have steadily increased since the late 1970s.
